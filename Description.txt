Shell Context Menu Handler

In Windows if you right-click on any file, a context menu appears detailing a number of actions that can be undertaken on that file. Shell Context Menu Handler allows you to add such an option to a file type by simply locating the extension you wish to affect in the lisbox on the left of the application and then creating a name and command pair for it.
